# Uptrace

[Uptrace](https://uptrace.dev) is an open-source OpenTelemetry backend that stores traces, metrics, and logs in ClickHouse and uses Postgres for metadata (users, projects, alerts). It has a polished UI, PromQL support on metrics, and per-project DSN ingestion tokens so you can multi-tenant one deployment across several apps.

**Signals:** traces + metrics + logs. **Deployment:** local (docker compose) or self-hosted. **Cost:** OSS (premium features require a license key).

## One-command quickstart

The plugin ships a trimmed compose that boots just what hermes-otel needs (ClickHouse + Postgres + Redis + Uptrace — no collector, no Grafana, no Mailpit):

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes_otel
docker compose -f docker-compose/uptrace/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Wait ~20s for ClickHouse to finish applying migrations, then open the UI at http://localhost:14318 and log in with the seeded admin:

- **Email:** `admin@uptrace.local`
- **Password:** `admin`

Point the plugin at it — minimal `config.yaml`:

```yaml
backends:
  - type: uptrace
    endpoint: http://localhost:14318/v1/traces
    dsn: http://project1_secret@localhost:14318?grpc=14317

capture_logs: true
```

The `dsn` value is the ingestion DSN for the seeded project (`hermes-agent` under org `hermes-otel`, token `project1_secret`). The plugin sends it as the `uptrace-dsn` header on every OTLP request; Uptrace uses it to route data to the right project.

## Why a dedicated `type: uptrace`

Uptrace authenticates with a custom `uptrace-dsn` header that `type: otlp` can't synthesise for you. Declaring `type: uptrace` asks the plugin to:

1. Read `dsn:` (or `dsn_env:` → env var → `UPTRACE_DSN` / `OTEL_UPTRACE_DSN`).
2. Set the `uptrace-dsn` request header automatically.
3. Display `✓ Uptrace at <endpoint>` in startup logs.
4. Enable all three signals (`supports_metrics=True`, `supports_logs=True`).

Keep secrets out of `config.yaml` — use `dsn_env` and set the variable in your shell:

```yaml
backends:
  - type: uptrace
    endpoint: http://localhost:14318/v1/traces
    dsn_env: UPTRACE_DSN
```

```bash
export UPTRACE_DSN='http://project1_secret@localhost:14318?grpc=14317'
```

## Ports

| Port | Service | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 5432 | Postgres | Uptrace metadata store |
| 8123 | ClickHouse | HTTP query API |
| 9000 | ClickHouse | Native protocol |
| 14317 | Uptrace | OTLP/gRPC receiver |
| 14318 | Uptrace | **UI + OTLP/HTTP receiver — the plugin exports here** |

Port 14318 was picked specifically to avoid the standard 4318 used by LGTM / Jaeger / SigNoz, so Uptrace can run alongside them. The only likely conflict is port 5432 with a host-installed PostgreSQL — stop it or remap in `docker-compose/uptrace/docker-compose.yaml`.

## What you'll see in the UI

**Traces:**
Navigation → Traces. Every attribute the plugin emits is searchable (OpenInference + GenAI + `hermes.*`). Group by `llm.model_name`, `openinference.span.kind`, `hermes.session.kind`, etc. Click a trace to see the full waterfall with the same attributes Phoenix and Grafana show.

**Metrics:**
Navigation → Metrics. Query with PromQL over any `hermes_*` metric the plugin emits:

- `hermes_session_count_total` — sessions started
- `hermes_token_usage_total` — prompt / completion tokens by provider / model
- `hermes_tool_duration_bucket` — tool execution histogram

**Logs:**
Navigation → Logs. When `capture_logs: true` is on, every `logger.info(...)` from hermes or the plugin lands here. A line logged during a turn carries that turn's `trace_id` and `span_id`, `hermes.session_id` and `hermes.log.attribution`; lines the plugin cannot attribute to a turn (between turns, or from another thread while several sessions are active) arrive without trace ids. Click a log record's `trace_id` to jump into the corresponding trace. See [OTel logs](/configuration/logs#where-the-ids-come-from) for the attribution rules.

## Dashboard

The bundled dashboard's Uptrace adapter (and the `observability` skill with
`--source uptrace`) reads traces, **metrics and logs** back through Uptrace 2's
`/internal/v1` API. That API is authenticated with a **user token**, not the
project token inside the DSN, so the backend entry needs one more key:

```yaml
  - type: uptrace
    endpoint: http://localhost:14318/v1/traces
    dsn_env: UPTRACE_DSN
    user_token_env: UPTRACE_USER_TOKEN   # Settings → API tokens, or the seeded user_tokens entry
    # query_port: 443                    # when the API sits behind an HTTPS ingress
    # project_id: 1
```

Uptrace 2.1 and 2.0 spell that API differently (2.1 has one route per signal,
`/spans/{project}`, `/logs/{project}`, `/traces/{project}/{id}`, with
`time_start`/`time_end` and typed attribute keys such as
`hermes_session_id::str`; 2.0 keeps everything under `/tracing/{project}/…` with
`time_gte`/`time_lt`). The adapter asks the server once per process which one it
speaks and remembers the answer; the dashboard's status shows it as `api_dialect`.
The 2.1 spelling was taken from Uptrace's own UI requests and checked against
2.1.0-beta.5 (the version `docker-compose/uptrace/docker-compose.yaml` pins); the 2.0 spelling
is the one recorded against 2.0.2 when the adapter was written.

Metrics go through MQL (`metric=<name>&alias=$m` plus `$m group by model`,
`sum($m)`, `avg($m)`, `max($m)`, `count($m)`); a counter only supports its
per-interval sum, so the other aggregates fall back to it. Logs are the span
store's `log:*` systems: `--level` narrows the systems, `--trace`, `--session`,
`--logger` and `--event` become `where` clauses on `_trace_id`,
`hermes_session_id`, `otel_library_name` and `event_name` (`--events-only` is
`where event_name exists`), and `--text` uses Uptrace's search. The logger list
is the `otel_library_name` attribute's values with counts, scoped to the
agent's service so Uptrace's own log lines stay out of it.

Timestamps on this API are milliseconds and attribute keys are flattened with
underscores; the adapter strips 2.1's type suffixes and maps the keys back to
the documented dotted names.

## Rotating the DSN

The seeded token `project1_secret` is fine for local dev; change it before exposing the stack anywhere:

1. Edit `docker-compose/uptrace/uptrace.yml` and change `project_tokens[0].token`.
2. Restart the stack — `seed_data.update: true` in the config applies changes on boot.
3. Update the `dsn` (or `UPTRACE_DSN` env var) in your hermes-otel config to match.

Or, do it from the UI: Settings → Projects → Edit → rotate token, then update the plugin config.

## Multi-backend fan-out

Uptrace plays nicely alongside other backends because its ports don't collide:

```yaml
backends:
  - type: uptrace
    endpoint: http://localhost:14318/v1/traces
    dsn_env: UPTRACE_DSN

  - type: phoenix
    endpoint: http://localhost:6006/v1/traces

capture_logs: true
```

Traces fan out to both; metrics and logs go only to Uptrace (Phoenix ingests traces only — the plugin skips it automatically).

## Troubleshooting

**"Uptrace is up but I see `unauthorized` in the agent logs"**

The `uptrace-dsn` header is missing or its token doesn't match the seed config. Confirm the DSN matches `project_tokens[0].token` in `docker-compose/uptrace/uptrace.yml`.

**"I see `✓ Uptrace at ...` but no traces appear"**

Uptrace batches writes to ClickHouse — first traces may take 10-30s to show up. If they still don't appear, check `docker logs hermes-otel-uptrace` for ClickHouse connection errors.

**"ClickHouse container is unhealthy"**

Usually a port bind conflict on 8123 or 9000. Stop any other ClickHouse running on the host (a SigNoz stack, for example) before bringing Uptrace up.

**"Postgres container is unhealthy"**

Host-installed PostgreSQL is almost certainly bound to 5432 already. Either stop it or remap the compose port: `ports: ["5433:5432"]` and adjust your firewall rules.

## Production usage

The shipped compose uses `seed_data` for local bootstrap — fine for dev, not for prod. For a production deployment you should:

- Disable `seed_data` after initial bootstrap (or set it to a non-admin user / restricted org).
- Change `service.secret` to a real secret (used for cryptographic operations).
- Point `ch_cluster.shards[].replicas[].addr` at a real ClickHouse cluster (replicated or distributed), not the single-node container.
- Put a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) in front and enable TLS.
- Replace the seeded users / tokens with real ones via the UI.

See [Uptrace's production docs](https://uptrace.dev/get/hosted/production) for the full checklist.
