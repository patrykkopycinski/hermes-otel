# Backends overview

hermes-otel speaks plain **OTLP/HTTP**, so any OTLP-compatible backend should work — but these are the ones that ship with first-class support, docker-compose files, and (where relevant) smoke-test coverage.

## Quick picks

**"I just want to see a trace, right now, on my laptop"**
→ [Phoenix](/backends/phoenix) — one container, open the UI on port 6006, done.

**"I want pretty LLM-specific UI and I'm fine running a stack"**
→ [Langfuse](/backends/langfuse) — polished UI for LLM traces, free cloud tier, robust self-host.

**"I want traces *and* the token/tool/cost metrics dashboard"**
→ [SigNoz](/backends/signoz), [LGTM](/backends/lgtm) or [OpenObserve](/backends/openobserve) — they accept OTLP metrics as well as traces (Phoenix does not).

**"I want all three signals — traces, metrics, AND logs — in Grafana, in one container"**
→ [Grafana LGTM](/backends/lgtm) — `grafana/otel-lgtm` bundles Grafana + Tempo + Loki + Mimir + a collector. Pair with `capture_logs: true` and you get [trace-id-correlated logs](/configuration/logs) out of the box.

**"I'm already on LangChain / LangSmith"**
→ [LangSmith](/backends/langsmith) — free personal tier, zero extra infra.

**"Standard distributed tracing stack, no LLM-specific UI needed"**
→ [Jaeger](/backends/jaeger) or [Grafana Tempo](/backends/tempo) — both are traces-only; pair with Prometheus if you need metrics.

**"I want a cloud backend with a generous free tier and all three signals"**
→ [Honeycomb](/backends/honeycomb) — OTLP-native; set `OTEL_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` and a region.

**"I want W&B's Agents and Traces UI for Hermes runs"**
→ [W&B Weave](/backends/weave) — direct OTLP trace ingest with `OTEL_WEAVE_API_KEY`, `wandb.entity`, and `wandb.project`.

**"I want Hermes agent runs plus traces, metrics, and logs in Parseable"**
→ [Parseable](/backends/parseable) — direct OTLP ingest into three datasets, with Agent Observability and a ready-made dashboard.

**"I want a hosted backend purpose-built for LLM/agent telemetry, `gen_ai.*`-native"**
→ [telemetry.dev](/backends/telemetry) — OTLP ingest with a single `Authorization: Bearer` header, via the generic `otlp` type.

**"My company already has an OTel collector / New Relic / Datadog"**
→ [Generic OTLP](/backends/otlp) — point at its ingest endpoint and it just works.

**"I want several of the above simultaneously"**
→ [Multi-backend fan-out](/backends/multi-backend) — same spans, parallel, non-blocking.

## Signal support

Backends differ in which OTel signals they accept. The plugin auto-skips signals a backend can't take — you don't need to configure anything.

| Backend | Traces | Metrics | Logs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phoenix | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Langfuse | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| LangSmith | ✅ (via HTTP Run API, not OTLP) | ❌ | ❌ |
| SigNoz | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Jaeger | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Grafana Tempo | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Grafana LGTM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Uptrace | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenObserve | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Parseable | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Honeycomb | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| W&B Weave | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| telemetry.dev | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Generic OTLP | ✅ | depends on collector | depends on collector |

If you care about token / tool / cost metrics on a traces-only backend, pair it with a Prometheus-compatible sink or fan out to SigNoz / LGTM / OpenObserve alongside. See [OTel logs](/configuration/logs) for the logs pipeline.

## Metrics and your backend

Two metric settings depend on the backend (since 1.15; details on the [metrics reference](/reference/metrics)):

| Backend | Temporality it wants | Preset | Exponential histograms |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grafana LGTM, Tempo-side Prometheus, Mimir | cumulative (delta is dropped unless `otlp-deltatocumulative` is on) | cumulative (default) | Prometheus 3.8+ native histograms; Mimir only with native-histogram ingestion enabled |
| OpenObserve | cumulative works; delta handling undocumented | cumulative (default) | not documented |
| SigNoz | recommends delta; exponential histograms are delta-only and self-hosted-only | `delta` | self-hosted only |
| Uptrace | prefers delta, converts cumulative | `delta` | recommended |
| Honeycomb | either | cumulative (default) | not verified |
| Parseable, generic `otlp` | depends on the collector behind it | cumulative (default) | depends |
| Datadog, New Relic, Logfire (via generic `otlp` today, explicit types tracked in #232) | delta required (Datadog rejects cumulative sums; Logfire dashboards stay empty on cumulative; New Relic prefers delta) | set `metrics_temporality: delta` on the entry | Datadog and New Relic accept them |

Override per entry with `metrics_temporality: cumulative | delta`, or for every backend with the top-level `metrics_temporality`. `metrics_histogram: exponential` switches every backend to base-2 exponential histograms, so use it only when all of them accept those.

**Short-lived runs.** `hermes -z` exports metrics once, when it exits. A single cumulative point from a fresh process counts as zero on Datadog and New Relic (they treat the first point as a baseline) and goes stale after five minutes on Prometheus; the same run exported as delta counts in full on every delta-capable backend. Long-lived gateways are unaffected either way.

## Selecting a single backend

Single-backend selection is env-var-driven. First match wins:

1. `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` → LangSmith
2. Langfuse credentials + at least one `OTEL_LANGFUSE_*` variable (`OTEL_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_API_KEY`, `OTEL_LANGFUSE_SECRET_API_KEY` or `OTEL_LANGFUSE_ENDPOINT`) → Langfuse
3. `OTEL_SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT` set → SigNoz
4. `OTEL_UPTRACE_ENDPOINT` + DSN set → Uptrace
5. `OTEL_OPENOBSERVE_ENDPOINT` + credentials set → OpenObserve
6. `OTEL_PARSEABLE_ENDPOINT` + `PARSEABLE_API_KEY` set → Parseable
7. `OTEL_WEAVE_API_KEY` (or `OTEL_WEAVE_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_WEAVE_BASE_URL`) + `WANDB_ENTITY` + `WANDB_PROJECT` set → W&B Weave
8. `OTEL_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` (or `OTEL_HONEYCOMB_ENDPOINT`) set → Honeycomb
9. `OTEL_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` set → Jaeger
10. `OTEL_TEMPO_ENDPOINT` set → Tempo
11. `OTEL_PHOENIX_ENDPOINT` set → Phoenix

Vendor SDK variables (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `WANDB_API_KEY`, `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`) only fill in credentials. On their own they never switch export on, because they are often set for other tools and Hermes loads `$HERMES_HOME/.env` into the process; one plugin-namespaced `OTEL_*` variable is the explicit opt-in. When such credentials are present without the opt-in, the startup log says which `OTEL_*` variable would enable export, and the dashboard's OTel → Settings → Environment view shows the same notice.

Setting `backends:` in `config.yaml` overrides the env-var flow entirely — see [Multi-backend fan-out](/backends/multi-backend).

## Running one locally

Every self-hostable backend above, plus the candidates tracked in [#232](https://github.com/briancaffey/hermes-otel/issues/232), has its own folder under [`docker-compose/`](https://github.com/briancaffey/hermes-otel/tree/main/docker-compose) in the repo: `docker compose -f docker-compose/<name>/docker-compose.yaml up -d`, and `down -v` to remove it with its data. Each folder has a README (why pick it, logins, the `backends:` snippet, verification query, caveats), and [`docker-compose/README.md`](https://github.com/briancaffey/hermes-otel/blob/main/docker-compose/README.md) is the manual: the comparison table, the port map, disk/memory budgets and the test loop.

Backends without an explicit `type:` yet are driven through the generic `otlp` type; each was verified end to end on 2026-10-05 with hermes-otel 1.19.0:

| Backend | Compose file | Stored from a Hermes turn | Plugin config |
|---|---|---|---|
| [OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit) (#222) | `openlit/` | traces + metrics + logs | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:4338/v1/traces` |
| [MLflow](https://mlflow.org) (#221) | `mlflow/` | traces (with MLflow's own token and cost roll-ups) | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:5001/v1/traces`, header `x-mlflow-experiment-id: "0"`, `metrics: false`, `logs: false` |
| [Comet Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) (#220) | `opik/` | traces (threads, span types, cost) | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel/v1/traces`, `metrics: false`, `logs: false` |
| [Laminar](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr) (#223) | `laminar/` | traces + logs; metrics accepted and dropped | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:8100/v1/traces`, `Authorization: Bearer <project key>`, `metrics: false` |
| [LangWatch](https://github.com/langwatch/langwatch) (#229) | `langwatch/` | traces + metrics + logs | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:5560/api/otel/v1/traces`, `Authorization: Bearer <project key>` |
| [Langtrace](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace) (#224) | `langtrace/` | traces (string and int attributes only) | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:3040/api/trace`, header `x-api-key`, `metrics: false`, `logs: false` |
| [Sigiro](https://sigiro.com) (#71) | `sigiro/` | traces + metrics + logs | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:4378/v1/traces` |
| [Maple Local](https://maple.dev/local/) (#49) | `maple/` | traces + metrics + logs | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:4388/v1/traces` |
| [Parseable OSS](https://www.parseable.com) (#238) | `parseable/` | traces + metrics + logs, through the bundled collector | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:4348/v1/traces` |
| [Latitude](https://github.com/latitude-dev/latitude-llm) (#230) | `latitude/` | not yet run (13 containers, ~15 GB of images) | `type: otlp`, `http://localhost:3002/v1/traces`, bearer key + `X-Latitude-Project` |

Two of these are not open source: Sigiro publishes only a binary image, and Maple is source-available under FSL-1.1. [Jaeger v2](/backends/jaeger) (`jaeger-v2/`) and [Langfuse v4](/backends/langfuse) (`LANGFUSE_VERSION=4`) have their own stacks so the read-side issues #245 and #246 can be reproduced locally.

## Planned

These are OTLP-compatible and should work today with the generic OTLP backend — first-class docs, docker-compose files, and smoke tests are on the roadmap:

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) — cloud, 100 GB/mo free tier
- [Elastic APM](https://www.elastic.co/observability/application-performance-monitoring) — self-host or Elastic Cloud
- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) — cloud, trial only

File an issue if you've tried one of these and hit friction — we'll prioritise.
