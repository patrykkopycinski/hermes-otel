# Elastic

[Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/observability) ingests OpenTelemetry traces, metrics and logs into Elasticsearch data streams. hermes-otel speaks plain OTLP/HTTP to it, so both deployment shapes work with one `type: elastic` entry:

- **Elastic Cloud (managed OTLP, "mOTLP")** — one endpoint per Elastic Cloud project, authenticated with an API key: `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` (not `Bearer`).
- **Self-hosted EDOT Collector** — your own [Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent) collector on the network; typically no auth at all.

**Signals:** traces + metrics + logs. **Cost:** depends on your Elastic license/plan.

## Quick start

### Elastic Cloud (mOTLP)

Create an API key in Kibana (**Stack Management → API Keys**, or `POST /_security/api_key` with `name: "hermes-otel"`), then:

```yaml
backends:
  - type: elastic
    endpoint: https://<hash>.apm.<region>.gcp.elastic-cloud.com:443
    api_key_env: OTEL_ELASTIC_API_KEY
```

```bash
export OTEL_ELASTIC_API_KEY="<base64 api key>"
```

The plugin appends `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/logs` to the endpoint as needed and sends `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` on every export.

### Self-hosted EDOT Collector

```yaml
backends:
  - type: elastic
    endpoint: http://localhost:4318
```

No API key is needed for a collector on a trusted network: when no key resolves, the `Authorization` header is omitted entirely (set one anyway if your collector has auth enabled — the header shape is the same).

A complete local stack (Elasticsearch + Kibana + EDOT Collector) ships in [`docker-compose/elastic/`](https://github.com/briancaffey/hermes-otel/tree/main/docker-compose/elastic), ports bound to 127.0.0.1 only:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose/elastic/docker-compose.yml up -d
uv run --extra dev python scripts/verify_elastic.py   # end-to-end smoke: export + verify in ES
./scripts/import_elastic_dashboard.sh                 # optional: hermes-otel dashboard in Kibana
```

The bundled dashboard (`docker-compose/elastic/dashboards.ndjson`) ships five panels — top span names, spans by operation, token usage by token type (sum of `hermes.token.usage`), tool-call duration by tool (median, as a bar chart), and messages per model (sum of `hermes.model.usage`) — rendered with real session data in [`dashboard.png`](https://github.com/briancaffey/hermes-otel/blob/main/docker-compose/elastic/dashboard.png). Kibana listens on `http://127.0.0.1:15602` (security disabled).

### Importing into a security-enabled Kibana

On a Kibana with security enabled (Elastic Cloud, or a local stack started with `xpack.security.enabled=true`), the unauthenticated import request is rejected with HTTP 401. Pass credentials via environment variables — they are never echoed or logged:

```bash
# API key (recommended): create one in Stack Management → API Keys, or
# POST /_security/api_key with {"name": "hermes-otel-dashboard"}
export KIBANA_API_KEY="<base64 api key>"
./scripts/import_elastic_dashboard.sh https://<your-kibana>:5601

# or basic auth
export KIBANA_USERNAME=elastic KIBANA_PASSWORD="<password>"
./scripts/import_elastic_dashboard.sh https://<your-kibana>:5601
```

`KIBANA_API_KEY` takes precedence when both are set; with neither set the request is sent unauthenticated, which keeps the no-login compose path working.

The credentials are passed to `curl` on stdin rather than on its command line, so they do not show up in `ps` output. The script exits non-zero if Kibana is unreachable, answers with a non-200 status, or answers 200 with `"success": false` (it then lists the object ids that failed to import); on success it prints the `successCount`.

## Why a dedicated `type: elastic`

Trace export also works through the [generic OTLP](/backends/otlp) type with a hand-written endpoint and header. Declaring `type: elastic` instead asks the plugin to:

1. Read `api_key:` (or `api_key_env:` → env var → `OTEL_ELASTIC_API_KEY` / `ELASTIC_API_KEY`).
2. Send the key as `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` — the scheme Elastic's mOTLP endpoint requires — and omit the header entirely when there is no key.
3. Default `metrics_temporality: delta`: Elasticsearch does not handle cumulative histograms ([Elastic OTel limitations](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/opentelemetry/compatibility/limitations#histogram-and-counter-temporality)).
4. Route optional `dataset` / `namespace` fields to the `data_stream.dataset` / `data_stream.namespace` Resource attributes (see [Data streams](#data-streams)).

## Configuration reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | string | **Required.** mOTLP URL or EDOT Collector OTLP/HTTP base. Also via `OTEL_ELASTIC_ENDPOINT`. A base URL gets the per-signal `/v1/*` suffixes automatically |
| `api_key` | string | API key (discouraged inline — use `api_key_env`). Sent as `Authorization: ApiKey <key>` |
| `api_key_env` | string | Env var holding the key (`OTEL_ELASTIC_API_KEY` / `ELASTIC_API_KEY` fallbacks) |
| `dataset` | string | Optional `data_stream.dataset` Resource attribute |
| `namespace` | string | Optional `data_stream.namespace` Resource attribute |

## Data streams

Elasticsearch stores OTLP data in data streams keyed by `data_stream.*` Resource attributes. By default the dataset is derived per signal (`traces`, `metrics.*`, `logs.*`) and the namespace defaults to `default`. Set them explicitly when you want everything in one namespace or a custom dataset prefix:

```yaml
backends:
  - type: elastic
    endpoint: https://<hash>.apm.eu-west-1.gcp.elastic-cloud.com:443
    api_key_env: OTEL_ELASTIC_API_KEY
    dataset: hermes_otel
    namespace: agents
```

Spans land in `traces-hermes_otel-agents`, metrics in `metrics-hermes_otel-agents`, logs in `logs-hermes_otel-agents`. Nothing is routed outside your Elastic deployment — the attributes only name data streams inside it. `dataset` and `namespace` must be valid data-stream components — lowercase alphanumerics and `_` only, up to 100 chars, no `-` (data-stream names are split on `-`) — invalid values fail at config-load with a clear error instead of being silently rewritten or creating unreachable indices at runtime.

## Metrics temporality

Elasticsearch histograms do not support cumulative temporality; cumulative counters are also converted lossily. The plugin therefore defaults this backend to `metrics_temporality: delta`, matching the per-backend `metrics_temporality` knob (see the SigNoz/Datadog discussion in [#226](https://github.com/briancaffey/hermes-otel/issues/226)). You can still override it per entry with `metrics_temporality: cumulative` if your pipeline handles conversion downstream.

## Logs

The elastic backend exports logs when `capture_logs: true` is set (it is not on by default). Log records land in the `logs-<dataset>-<namespace>` data stream, one stream per signal; verified with a real `hermes -z` session against the bundled compose stack — spans, delta metrics and log records (with readable `body.text`) each in their own stream. One caveat: the OTel SDK's `LoggingHandler` emits log records asynchronously in batches, so the last few records of a short-lived session may not flush before shutdown; long-running sessions lose nothing.

## Troubleshooting

- **`401 Unauthorized`** — the key is wrong, expired, or sent with the wrong scheme. The plugin always uses `ApiKey`; check the key in Kibana (**Stack Management → API Keys**).
- **`elastic requires endpoint`** — no `endpoint:` and no `OTEL_ELASTIC_ENDPOINT` set. Unlike SaaS backends there is no default host to fall back on.
- **Metrics missing / wrong bucket counts** — temporality mismatch; leave the `delta` preset in place.
